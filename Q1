Purpose of var() Function

Reusability: CSS variables allow us to store values that we can reuse across our stylesheet. The var()
function lets us reference these values wherever needed, reducing redundancy and making our code
cleaner©
}
Consistency: By using variables, we can ensure consistent values for colors, spacing, fonts, and more
throughout our entire design. Changing a variable's value will automatically update all instances where the
variable is used©
x
Global Changes: If we need to make a design change, we can update the variable's value once, and the
change will be applied to all instances using that variable.
